# Random-Click-Points
A very basic WebGL application in which you click on a location to add a randomly colored 'pixel'. Very exciting stuff here!

# What I Learnt

* A greater understanding of certain aspects of WebGL

  * The different types of variables within GLSL ES 
  * Getting the storage location of attribute/uniform variables
  * Assigning a value to an attribute/uniform variable
  * Conversion from the default <canvas> coordinate system to the one used with WebGL
